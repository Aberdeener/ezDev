# ezDev
 
Hi!
This will be my attempt at my own version of Skript.
This is not a competitor and will likely never see public release (unless y'all wanna compile yourself).
I have a massive list of TODO's and bugs to fix already.
Many more actions, targets and events are planned!
I will be commenting my code today so we can all understand it better :laughing: 
There are lots of `logger#info()` around right now, these are just for development and testing!
Right now I am focusing on getting the commands fully working, but I do have some boilerplate code for Listeners and Runnables.

For syntax information along with some documentation, check out syntax.md!
